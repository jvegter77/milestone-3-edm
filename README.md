Festival website for festival attendants

The focus of this project is to build an application to allow people to create
festivals and alert other users of the site of festivals in their country or abroad.

UX

This application is for fans of festivals, specifically edm festivals but it can
be used for other events as well.

User stories:
- I want to create a festival to make other enthousiasts aware of this festival
- I want to upload personal experiences about this festival
- I want to be able to share photo's and video's of this festival
- I want to be able to delete video's and photo's I have uploaded
- I want to be able to change festival info
-  I want to be able to change my profile

The inspiration for this application is the large number of festivals worldwide
and the local knowledge of these festivals. The idea is to inspire application users
to find new festivals.

I have carefully looked at other websites. They mostely have a calendar of upcoming 
festivals but not a way to create a festival you care about.

In the root directory of the site I have created mockup files and wireframes for the
design of the application.

Features:
- Create a new festival
- Upload videos of that festival
- Edit existing festivals
- Create a profile and edit or delete your profile
- Get ifno about the festival like genre, dates, times and locations

Existing features:

Features left to implement:
- Create an extensive calendar for festivals
- Chat application for users
- Meet up functionality

Technologies used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Python
- Flask
- Mongo DB
